*Interview instructions have been moved [here](./docs/instructions.md)*

## Selected Option: Option 2

For this technical test, I decided to go for **Option 2** in order to work a bit more in the UI. Please, find bellow the time used for every aspect of the app development:

* Functionality without UI: ~4.5 h
* UI: ~4 h

Please, to find more about why I spend more time than the suggested originally for the functionality side, see the section [`Challenges`](#markdown-header-challenges)

## Comments

I would like to start saying that I'm very happy with the final result, specially with the design of the UI. I really enjoy doing my own designs.

Regarding with the development, I found this technical assigment very exciting as it has been a good opportunity to display a wide range of skills.
One of the most instersting thing has been working using Sagas. Personally, I have always used redux + thunks as my state management tool, but after working in this app, I can seen the advantages that sagas offer on big scales.

I would like to flag that as I was running out of time, I only added tests where I considered it was more relevant for this project. Normally, I would try to cover most of the app. Please, let me know if these are enough.

## Improvements

There are some improvements that I would like to do if I had more time to work on this application. These improvements are:

* Mobile version. It is not fully adapted for mobile version now, but should be very easy to do.
* Increase test coverage.


## Challenges

My biggest challenge for this project has been working with Sagas.
As I mentioned before under the Comments section, I normally work with thunks therefore I have to spend a little more of the estimated time reading documentation about how to use integrate it and how to test it. It has been a great experience and without no doubt, it will be a skill that I will develop further.
